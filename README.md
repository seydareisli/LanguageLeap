# LanguageLeap: Quick Transitions in Coding Languages

Welcome to LanguageLeap! This repository offers quick guides for transitioning between popular programming languages.

Created by me, Seyda Reisli. Feel free to get in touch for any suggestions, corrections, or collaborations at seydareisli @ gmail.com

## What's Inside?

Each guide within LanguageLeap has been designed to make your transition from one programming language to another as seamless as possible. Whether you're shifting from Python to R or Matlab to Python, these guides offer quick refreshers on syntax differences and key features to help you get up to speed.

## The Story Behind

A few years ago, I was working with a student who was fluent in Python, but our project required him to switch gears and work with Matlab, a language he was unfamiliar with. It was then when I had the idea of preparing a quick and efficient guide that he could use to transition to Matlab seamlessly by using his existing knowledge about Python. With that, the first guide of LanguageLeap was born: a three-minute Matlab primer for Python programmers.

He found it incredibly useful. Seeing the positive impact it had, I realized this approach could be beneficial for many others who find themselves in similar situations. I then began creating similar guides for other language transitions. Hopefully it willprovide a swift "kick-start" helping you transition between languages smoothly.
